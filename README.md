# Final project

Please read this before accesing our final project. Our project is about weather and health for a better day. The Weather Recommendation App is a web-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for a specified city. It goes beyond presenting basic weather metrics, offering personalized clothing and activity recommendations based on the current and forecasted weather conditions.

#Features

City-based Weather Information: Upon entering the name of a city, users receive real-time data about the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions for that location.

Interactive City Map: An integrated map displays the geographic location of the entered city, providing visual context to users.

Clothing Recommendations: The app suggests appropriate clothing items based on the current weather conditions. For instance, it might recommend a winter coat and gloves during cold conditions or a t-shirt and shorts during warmer weather.

Activity Recommendations: In addition to clothing suggestions, the app proposes activities that are suitable for the current weather. For example, during rainy weather, indoor activities like "Indoor Climbing" might be suggested, while sunny conditions might lead to recommendations like "Beach Volleyball" or "Kite Flying."

Three-Day Weather Forecast: Users are not limited to just current weather data. The app provides an average temperature and prevalent weather conditions for the upcoming three days, assisting users in planning ahead.

Educational Link: A Wikipedia link related to the entered city is provided, allowing users to learn more about their location of interest.
