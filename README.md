# Final project

Please read this before accesing our final project. Our project is about weather and health for a better day. The Weather Recommendation App is a web-based application designed to provide users with real-time weather information for a specified city. It goes beyond presenting basic weather metrics, offering personalized clothing and activity recommendations based on the current and forecasted weather conditions.
